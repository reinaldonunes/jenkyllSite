# Localhost Repository

Customize your localhost's homepage, making it more beautiful and elegant.

It works with any PHP server, such as **WAMPP**, **XAMPP**, **LAMPP**, among others. 

####

### HOW TO USE?
Once you have your PHP server installed, make a clone of this project directly at the root of your localhost, with: 
```
git clone https://github.com/reinaldonunes/Localhost_Repository.git
```

After cloning, extract the files from the original folder and leave them in the root of your localhost.

Now, it will be working perfectly.

If you want to customize, edit the ``index.php`` file.

### ACCESSING THE SERVER
After placing the files, run your local server and access it by the address ``http://localhost/`` or the path configured by you.

Ready! Your localhost is now customized! See below how it will look:
